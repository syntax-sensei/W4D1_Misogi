# AI-Powered Recommendation Engine

A sophisticated e-commerce recommendation system built with Flask, featuring multiple recommendation algorithms, user authentication, and a modern web interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Recommendation System**: Content-based, collaborative filtering, and popularity-based recommendations
- **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**: Combines multiple approaches for optimal results
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system
- **Interactive Product Browsing**: View, like, and purchase products
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Dynamic recommendations based on user interactions
- **Modern Web Interface**: Responsive design with Bootstrap
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Unit tests for authentication and recommendation functionality

## üöÄ Architecture

### Database Models

The system uses SQLAlchemy with three main models:

- **User**: Stores user credentials and profile information
- **Product**: Comprehensive product catalog with 15+ attributes
- **UserInteraction**: Tracks user behavior (views, likes, purchases)

### Recommendation Engine

The `RecommendationEngine` class implements three core recommendation algorithms:

#### 1. Content-Based Filtering
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization on product text features
- Calculates cosine similarity between products
- Features: product name, category, subcategory, description, manufacturer
- Returns products similar to a given product

#### 2. Collaborative Filtering
- Builds user-item interaction matrix
- Uses weighted interaction scores (view=1, like=3, purchase=5)
- Finds similar users using cosine similarity
- Recommends products liked by similar users

#### 3. Popularity-Based Filtering
- Sorts products by featured status, rating, and sale status
- Provides baseline recommendations for new users
- Ensures popular items are always visible

#### 4. Hybrid Recommendations
- Combines all three approaches
- Removes duplicates and ranks by combined scores
- Provides diverse and relevant recommendations

## üéØ Recommendation Algorithm Details

### Content-Based Filtering Implementation

```python
def get_content_based_recommendations(self, product_id, n_recommendations=5):
    # TF-IDF vectorization of product features
    text_features = (
        self.products_df['product_name'] + ' ' +
        self.products_df['category'] + ' ' +
        self.products_df['subcategory'] + ' ' +
        self.products_df['description'] + ' ' +
        self.products_df['manufacturer']
    )
    
    # Calculate cosine similarity
    product_similarities = cosine_similarity(
        self.tfidf_matrix[product_idx:product_idx+1], 
        self.tfidf_matrix
    ).flatten()
```

### Collaborative Filtering Implementation

```python
def get_collaborative_recommendations(self, user_id, n_recommendations=5):
    # Build user-item matrix with weighted interactions
    interaction_weights = {'view': 1, 'like': 3, 'purchase': 5}
    
    # Find similar users using cosine similarity
    user_similarities = cosine_similarity(
        self.user_item_matrix.loc[user_id:user_id],
        self.user_item_matrix
    ).flatten()
```

### Hybrid Recommendation Strategy

```python
def get_hybrid_recommendations(self, user_id, product_id=None, n_recommendations=10):
    # Combine multiple recommendation approaches
    content_recs = self.get_content_based_recommendations(product_id, n_recommendations//3)
    collab_recs = self.get_collaborative_recommendations(user_id, n_recommendations//3)
    popular_recs = self.get_popularity_recommendations(n_recommendations//3)
    
    # Remove duplicates and rank by combined scores
    return unique_recommendations[:n_recommendations]
```
